    <!-- Article Content -->
    <main class="article-content container">
        <article>
            <p class="lead">It all began in early 2012, a year and a half before Apple introduced Touch ID with the iPhone 5s. Smartphones were already changing the rules of digital banking, but there was still no clear playbook — no design systems, no open APIs, and certainly no Figma files floating around Slack.</p>

            <p>That was when I joined the small experimental unit that would later become the UK's digital innovation hub for the "red bank." At the time, we were just a few designers, engineers, and data scientists hidden inside a respected IBAN department in Madrid. Our mission: to make data usable.</p>

            <p>The first challenge was deceptively simple — turn raw transaction records into something people could actually understand. We started categorising spending: groceries, rent, transport, insurance. Sounds obvious today, but in 2012 it wasn't. There were no public datasets, no merchant APIs, no ready-made logo libraries. We literally built them from scratch — gathering vendor IDs, matching them to retailers, hand-tracing logos that didn't even exist as transparent PNGs.</p>

            <h2>The Fundamental Question</h2>

            <p>And then came the big question that would define our next two years:</p>

            <p class="center-text"><strong>Do we go native or hybrid?</strong></p>

            <p>Should we build two separate apps — one for iOS, one for Android — each following its own design language? Or should we create a single hybrid codebase, a universal design system that could scale from phones to early wearables, even to TV-sized interfaces and 3000-pixel wall projections?</p>

            <p>It wasn't just a technical decision; it was a cultural one. Madrid pushed for brand consistency and efficiency — "one app, one look." Our UK team pushed back for user empathy and platform authenticity — "respect the native experience."</p>

            <p>The discussions were heated, sometimes personal. For Madrid, hybrid meant control. For us, native meant care.</p>

            <p>Looking back, both sides had their truth. The Spanish approach anticipated the cost and speed imperatives that now drive global releases. The UK view championed what we now call UX fidelity — meeting users where they are, not forcing them into one brand shell.</p>

            <p>And that tension — craft vs. scale, performance vs. efficiency — never really disappeared. It simply evolved. Every digital team still faces it today, whether designing an app, a platform, or an ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Because the real question isn't just native or hybrid.<br>
            It's how much of your product's soul you're willing to trade for convenience.</p>

            <h2>The Reality of Decision Making</h2>

            <p>In the end, the decision wasn't made in a workshop or a steering meeting — it was made under pressure. Deadlines, budgets, and politics did what endless debates couldn't.</p>

            <p>The main challenge was that Madrid's design team wanted to simply reuse existing brand guidelines and implement everything within 1-2 months. From a time perspective, I agreed with their efficiency goals, but I disagreed with their rushed approach that didn't consider user experience implications.</p>

            <h2>The Team Behind the Decision</h2>

            <p>This was a collaborative effort that involved an incredible team of designers, engineers, and managers:</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

            <p>The native vs. hybrid debate continues today, but the fundamental principles remain the same. Whether you're building your first mobile app or scaling to millions of users, the decision comes down to balancing:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Experience</strong> vs. <strong>Development Speed</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Platform Authenticity</strong> vs. <strong>Brand Consistency</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Long-term Maintainability</strong> vs. <strong>Initial Cost</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Performance</strong> vs. <strong>Resource Efficiency</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Looking at today's landscape, with frameworks like React Native, Flutter, and native development tools, the choice is more nuanced than ever. But the core question remains unchanged: what's best for your users, and what can your organization realistically deliver?</p>

            <p>The debate never really died — it just evolved to include more options, more complexity, and even higher stakes.</p>
