# Native vs. Hybrid: The Debate That Never Died

It all began in early 2012, a year and a half before Apple introduced Touch ID with the iPhone 5s. Smartphones were already changing the rules of digital banking, but there was still no clear playbook — no design systems, no open APIs, and certainly no Figma files floating around Slack.

That was when I joined the small experimental unit that would later become the UK’s digital innovation hub for the “red bank.” At the time, we were just a few designers, engineers, and data scientists hidden inside a respected IBAN department in Madrid. Our mission: to make data usable.

The first challenge was deceptively simple — turn raw transaction records into something people could actually understand. We started categorising spending: groceries, rent, transport, insurance. Sounds obvious today, but in 2012 it wasn’t. There were no public datasets, no merchant APIs, no ready-made logo libraries. We literally built them from scratch — gathering vendor IDs, matching them to retailers, hand-tracing logos that didn’t even exist as transparent PNGs.

And then came the big question that would define our next two years:
Do we go native or hybrid?

Should we build two separate apps — one for iOS, one for Android — each following its own design language? Or should we create a single hybrid codebase, a universal design system that could scale from phones to early wearables, even to TV-sized interfaces and 3000-pixel wall projections?

It wasn’t just a technical decision; it was a cultural one. Madrid pushed for brand consistency and efficiency — “one app, one look.” Our UK team pushed back for user empathy and platform authenticity — “respect the native experience.”

The discussions were heated, sometimes personal. For Madrid, hybrid meant control. For us, native meant care.

Looking back, both sides had their truth. The Spanish approach anticipated the cost and speed imperatives that now drive global releases. The UK view championed what we now call UX fidelity — meeting users where they are, not forcing them into one brand shell.

And that tension — craft vs. scale, performance vs. efficiency — never really disappeared. It simply evolved. Every digital team still faces it today, whether designing an app, a platform, or an ecosystem.

Because the real question isn’t just native or hybrid.
It’s how much of your product’s soul you’re willing to trade for convenience.

In the end, the decision wasn’t made in a workshop or a steering meeting — it was made under pressure. Deadlines, budgets, and politics did what endless debates couldn’t. The main problem was that Madrid's spanishj design team wanted just to reuse, main probem was  (as they spanish madrid wanted to enforce their retail brand guidelines, and call it a day - and mayeb do i t in a 1-2 month or tow. Which from the perspective of time - i agree with thr, didn’t egree that time.
